## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilizing a design template, we build this website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to bring the template to life and display the vision of our client into full creation. Optimizing these ideas into a responsive web page that demonstrate the design in all platforms.


## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to properly work with video media files in a webpage was the biggest lesson I learned during this project. Making sure the iframe was set up properly and utilized was KEY in executing an idea my client had. In addition, working with various different webpages was another lesson learned here too. Linking them, styling them and making it a seamless part of the UX/UI experience when accessing them as a user.
